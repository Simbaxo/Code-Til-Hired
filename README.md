### Day 1: September 12th, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Learned about authentication using PassportJS.

**Thoughts:**
- Wasn't able to get much done today. Will finish up the rest of the authentication for my YelpCamp Project tomorrow. 
------------

### Day 2: September 13th, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Learned more about authentication and how to implement it into projects. 

**Thoughts:**
- Again, I didn't do much today but I am closer to finishing the authentication section of my YelpCamp Project. Will hopefully finish today and start on the next section which is refactoring some of the code. 
------------

### Day 3: September 14th, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Finished adding authentication for YelpCamp.
- Started refactoring the routes for YelpCamp.

**Thoughts:**
- Didn't spend too much time today but I was able to compelete the final portion of the authentication section for YelpCamp Project. Also did some refactoring of the routes page for the same app. Learned the different techniques to connect routes on different file pages and cleaning up the app.js file. Tomorrow will finish some more cleaning up and ready YDKJS.  
------------

### Day 4: September 15th, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Completed Chapter 3: Function vs Block Scope on YDKJS: Scopes & Closures.
  - Scope From Functions
  - Hiding In Plain Scope
  - Collision Avoidance
  - Functions as Scopes
  - Blocks As Scopes
- Completed Chapter 4: Hoisting on YDKJS: Scopes & Closures. 
  - Functions First

**Thoughts:**
- Spent my coding time today reading more about JavaScript. Learned more about functions and their scopes. Functions are the most common unit of scope in JS. Variables and functions that are declared inside another function are essentially "hidden" fro any of the enclosing "scopes". Block-scope refers to the idea that variables and functions can belong to an arbitrary block of code, rather than only to the enclosing function.
- All declarations in a scope, regardless of where they appear, are processed first before the code itself is executed. You can visualize this as declarations (variables and functions) being "moved" to the top of their respective scopes, which we call "hoisting". Declarations themselves are hoisted, but assignments, even assignments of function expressions, are not hoisted. 
------------

### Day 5: September 16th, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Attended a React workshop and built a basic app.
  - [React Powerpoint Slideshow](https://kucharskimaciej.github.io/devmeetings-react-redux-workshop/#/)
  
**Thoughts:**
- The workshop was pretty cool but I knew most of the things which gave me confidence in my abilities. 
------------

### Day 6: September 17th, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Went over powerpoint from React workshop.

**Thoughts:**
- Today was a slow day as far as coding. Didn't accomplish much but I hope to step it up in the next coming days.
------------

### Day 7: September 18th, 2017, Monday


- Prevented an unauthenticated user from creating a campground in YelpCamp Project.
- Save username + id to newly created campground

**Thoughts:**
- Pretty simple process to prevent an unauthenticated user from creating a campground. However, I do need more practice on saving the username/id to the newly created campground. That process took a couple more steps and some which I didn't full grasp yet. 
------------

### Day 8: September 19th, 2017, Tuesday


- Learned how to add Edit Route
- Learned how to add Destroy Route
- Added Authorization to both Edit and Destroy buttons
  - Learned the difference betweent Authenitcation & Authorization

**Thoughts**
- Spent a good chunck of time creating the routes for edit and destroy. User now have the ability to do both. Authorization was added so only certain users will be able to edit and delete campgrounds. Both buttons are also hidden until the correct user is logged in. This is achieved through authorization. Tommorrow I add the same features to the comments section of the YelpCamp app.
------------

### Day 9: September 20th, 2017, Wednesday

- Applied Edit & Destroy routes and buttons.

**Thoughts**
- Same thing as yesterday, just applied those features to the comments section. Was good practice doing it a second time and getting more comfortable with it. Tomorrow I will do some refactoring. 
------------

### Day 10: September 21st, 2017, Thursday

- Refactor the middleware.
- Added flash messages with Bootstrap styling.

**Thoughts**
- Light day. The middleware refactor helped my application look much better. Adding the flash messages was a bit challenging and took my steps than I anticipated. It is much easier to add them on Rails. Overall it was a good day. 
------------

### Day 11: September 22nd, 2017, Friday

- Helpful error messages for YelpCamp

**Thoughts**
- There was a spelling mistake that was causing my error messages to not display. Once I noticed this I was able to get the error messages displaying correctly with the bootstrap styling. Lesson to be learned here is that pay attention to spelling and if I don't see it right away, take a break and come back to the application.
------------

### Day 12: September 23rd, 2017, Saturday

- Started a React App called IversonTube
  - Implemented the YouTube API

**Thoughts**
- I cloned Stephen Grider's ReduxSimpleStarter to use as a boilerplate for my React App called IversonTube. Learned how to add the YouTube API search using node package manager. 
------------

### Day 13: September 24th, 2017, Sunday

- Searchbar feature to IversonTube

**Thoughts**
- Created a new component for the IversonTube app called searchbar. This component displays a search/input box in the application. In the future this will allow users to search and request data from the YouTube API. 
------------

### Day 14: September 25th, 2017, Monday

- Learned about Class based components in React

**Thoughts**
- Learned alot more about components including class based components. Components let you split the UI into independent reusable pieces. You can define a component by writing a JavaScript function. You can also define components using a ES6 Class. 
------------

### Day 15: September 26th, 2017, Tuesday

- Handling user events in React

**Thoughts**
- Added console.log to show the output we get when a user inputs something in the searchbar. Each time a change happens the console logs the value of that change. 
------------

### Day 16: September 27th, 2017, Wednesday

- Controlled Components in React

**Thoughts**
- Added a local state to the class component. Will have to come back to this to get a greater context. 
------------

### Day 17: September 28th, 2017, Thursday

- Refactoring functional components in IversonTube 
- Learned about props

**Thoughts**
- Added the API Key in order to pull data from the keywords "Allen Iverson" in the YouTube API. 
------------

### Day 18: September 29th, 2017, Friday

- Creating a static site using GatsbyJS

**Thoughts**
- GatsbyJS seems like an amazing tool that I will probably be utilizing alot to create static sites using React. GatsbyJS is basically just a Progressive Web App generator for building static sites. In the future I plan on using this to create my Porfolio Page.
------------

### Day 19: September 30th, 2017, Saturday

- Created Video list items and details for IversonTube

**Thoughts**
- Created 2 more components to display a list of the Iverson videos and also display the details for each video. 
------------

### Day 20: October 1st, 2017, Sunday

- Update error handling and middleware for campgrounds and comments for YelpCamp

**Thoughts**
- There was a security error that caused the application to break if you changed the Campgrounds and Comments ID for the app. 
------------

### Day 21: October 2nd, 2017, Monday

- Full Screen Background image slider for YelpCamp
- Dynamic Price feature for YelpCamp

**Thoughts**
- Improved the landing page for the app. It now has a full screen background image slider that changes every 10 secs. The animation causes the images to fade into each other giving it a really nice effect. 
------------

### Day 22: October 3rd, 2017, Tuesday

- Deployed YelpCamp app to Heroku

**Thoughts**
- Finally got my YelpCamp project live on Heroku. I still have some more features that I am looking forward to implement but atleast the site is live now and people are able to view it. 
------------

### Day 23: October 4th, 2017, Wednesday

- Moment JS added to YelpCamp

**Thoughts**
- Fixed an issue that caused the show page not to display due to the jquery cdn. Updated the jquery cdn and that fixed the issue. Added moment js to show the time a campground or comment was created. Attempted to add maps to the campground but was helping trouble with that. Will have to come back to it soon.
------------

### Day 24: October 5th, 2017, Thursday

- JS Form Validation
- Hello World in ECMAScript

**Thoughts**
- Went to a meetup to learn JavaScript. They showed examples about JS Form Validation with validation expresssions and the conditions. Was also able to do my first submission to exercism ecmascript. Hello World is written in a different syntax but I was able to learn it after looking at others solution. Looking forward to doing more exerices in exercism to gain more knowledge of ecmascipt. 
------------

### Day 25: October 6th, 2017, Friday

- Took a break to relax.

**Thoughts**
- Didn't do much today except relax. Did read a few articles on JavaScript and React.
------------

### Day 26: October 7th, 2017, Saturday
