------------

### Day 1: September 12th, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Learned about authentication using PassportJS.

**Thoughts:**
- Wasn't able to get much done today. Will finish up the rest of the authentication for my YelpCamp Project tomorrow. 
------------

### Day 2: September 13th, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Learned more about authentication and how to implement it into projects. 

**Thoughts:**
- Again, I didn't do much today but I am closer to finishing the authentication section of my YelpCamp Project. Will hopefully finish today and start on the next section which is refactoring some of the code. 
------------

### Day 3: September 14th, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Finished adding authentication for YelpCamp.
- Started refactoring the routes for YelpCamp.

**Thoughts:**
- Didn't spend too much time today but I was able to compelete the final portion of the authentication section for YelpCamp Project. Also did some refactoring of the routes page for the same app. Learned the different techniques to connect routes on different file pages and cleaning up the app.js file. Tomorrow will finish some more cleaning up and ready YDKJS.  
------------

### Day 4: September 15th, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Completed Chapter 3: Function vs Block Scope on YDKJS: Scopes & Closures.
  - Scope From Functions
  - Hiding In Plain Scope
  - Collision Avoidance
  - Functions as Scopes
  - Blocks As Scopes
- Completed Chapter 4: Hoisting on YDKJS: Scopes & Closures. 
  - Functions First

**Thoughts:**
- Spent my coding time today reading more about JavaScript. Learned more about functions and their scopes. Functions are the most common unit of scope in JS. Variables and functions that are declared inside another function are essentially "hidden" fro any of the enclosing "scopes". Block-scope refers to the idea that variables and functions can belong to an arbitrary block of code, rather than only to the enclosing function.
- All declarations in a scope, regardless of where they appear, are processed first before the code itself is executed. You can visualize this as declarations (variables and functions) being "moved" to the top of their respective scopes, which we call "hoisting". Declarations themselves are hoisted, but assignments, even assignments of function expressions, are not hoisted. 
------------

### Day 5: September 16th, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Attended a React workshop and built a basic app.
  - [React Powerpoint Slideshow](https://kucharskimaciej.github.io/devmeetings-react-redux-workshop/#/)
  
**Thoughts:**
- The workshop was pretty cool but I knew most of the things which gave me confidence in my abilities. 
------------

### Day 6: September 17th, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Went over powerpoint from React workshop.

**Thoughts:**
- Today was a slow day as far as coding. Didn't accomplish much but I hope to step it up in the next coming days.
------------

### Day 7: September 18th, 2017, Monday


- Prevented an unauthenticated user from creating a campground in YelpCamp Project.
- Save username + id to newly created campground

**Thoughts:**
- Pretty simple process to prevent an unauthenticated user from creating a campground. However, I do need more practice on saving the username/id to the newly created campground. That process took a couple more steps and some which I didn't full grasp yet. 
------------

### Day 8: September 19th, 2017, Tuesday


- Learned how to add Edit Route
- Learned how to add Destroy Route
- Added Authorization to both Edit and Destroy buttons
  - Learned the difference betweent Authenitcation & Authorization

**Thoughts**
- Spent a good chunck of time creating the routes for edit and destroy. User now have the ability to do both. Authorization was added so only certain users will be able to edit and delete campgrounds. Both buttons are also hidden until the correct user is logged in. This is achieved through authorization. Tommorrow I add the same features to the comments section of the YelpCamp app.
------------

### Day 9: September 20th, 2017, Wednesday

- Applied Edit & Destroy routes and buttons.

**Thoughts**
- Same thing as yesterday, just applied those features to the comments section. Was good practice doing it a second time and getting more comfortable with it. Tomorrow I will do some refactoring. 
------------

### Day 10: September 21st, 2017, Thursday

- Refactor the middleware.
- Added flash messages with Bootstrap styling.

**Thoughts**
- Light day. The middleware refactor helped my application look much better. Adding the flash messages was a bit challenging and took my steps than I anticipated. It is much easier to add them on Rails. Overall it was a good day. 
------------

### Day 11: September 22nd, 2017, Friday

- Helpful error messages for YelpCamp

**Thoughts**
- There was a spelling mistake that was causing my error messages to not display. Once I noticed this I was able to get the error messages displaying correctly with the bootstrap styling. Lesson to be learned here is that pay attention to spelling and if I don't see it right away, take a break and come back to the application.
------------

### Day 12: September 23rd, 2017, Saturday

- Started a React App called IversonTube
  - Implemented the YouTube API

**Thoughts**
- I cloned Stephen Grider's ReduxSimpleStarter to use as a boilerplate for my React App called IversonTube. Learned how to add the YouTube API search using node package manager. 
------------

### Day 13: September 24th, 2017, Sunday

- Searchbar feature to IversonTube

**Thoughts**
- Created a new component for the IversonTube app called searchbar. This component displays a search/input box in the application. In the future this will allow users to search and request data from the YouTube API. 
------------

### Day 14: September 25th, 2017, Monday

- Learned about Class based components in React

**Thoughts**
- Learned alot more about components including class based components. Components let you split the UI into independent reusable pieces. You can define a component by writing a JavaScript function. You can also define components using a ES6 Class. 
------------

### Day 15: September 26th, 2017, Tuesday

- Handling user events in React

**Thoughts**
- Added console.log to show the output we get when a user inputs something in the searchbar. Each time a change happens the console logs the value of that change. 
------------

### Day 16: September 27th, 2017, Wednesday

- Controlled Components in React

**Thoughts**
- Added a local state to the class component. Will have to come back to this to get a greater context. 
------------

### Day 17: September 28th, 2017, Thursday

- Refactoring functional components in IversonTube 
- Learned about props

**Thoughts**
- Added the API Key in order to pull data from the keywords "Allen Iverson" in the YouTube API. 
------------

### Day 18: September 29th, 2017, Friday

- Creating a static site using GatsbyJS

**Thoughts**
- GatsbyJS seems like an amazing tool that I will probably be utilizing alot to create static sites using React. GatsbyJS is basically just a Progressive Web App generator for building static sites. In the future I plan on using this to create my Porfolio Page.
------------

### Day 19: September 30th, 2017, Saturday

- Created Video list items and details for IversonTube

**Thoughts**
- Created 2 more components to display a list of the Iverson videos and also display the details for each video. 
------------

### Day 20: October 1st, 2017, Sunday

- Update error handling and middleware for campgrounds and comments for YelpCamp

**Thoughts**
- There was a security error that caused the application to break if you changed the Campgrounds and Comments ID for the app. 
------------

### Day 21: October 2nd, 2017, Monday

- Full Screen Background image slider for YelpCamp
- Dynamic Price feature for YelpCamp

**Thoughts**
- Improved the landing page for the app. It now has a full screen background image slider that changes every 10 secs. The animation causes the images to fade into each other giving it a really nice effect. 
------------

### Day 22: October 3rd, 2017, Tuesday

- Deployed YelpCamp app to Heroku

**Thoughts**
- Finally got my YelpCamp project live on Heroku. I still have some more features that I am looking forward to implement but atleast the site is live now and people are able to view it. 
------------

### Day 23: October 4th, 2017, Wednesday

- Moment JS added to YelpCamp

**Thoughts**
- Fixed an issue that caused the show page not to display due to the jquery cdn. Updated the jquery cdn and that fixed the issue. Added moment js to show the time a campground or comment was created. Attempted to add maps to the campground but was helping trouble with that. Will have to come back to it soon.
------------

### Day 24: October 5th, 2017, Thursday

- JS Form Validation
- Hello World in ECMAScript

**Thoughts**
- Went to a meetup to learn JavaScript. They showed examples about JS Form Validation with validation expresssions and the conditions. Was also able to do my first submission to exercism ecmascript. Hello World is written in a different syntax but I was able to learn it after looking at others solution. Looking forward to doing more exerices in exercism to gain more knowledge of ecmascipt. 
------------

### Day 25: October 6th, 2017, Friday

- Took a break to relax.

**Thoughts**
- Didn't do much today except relax. Did read a few articles on JavaScript and React.
------------

### Day 26: October 7th, 2017, Saturday

- GatsbyJS

**Thoughts**
- Was able to set up static blog site using GatsbyJS. Need more practice with React and GraphQL to get a better understanding of what exactly GatsbyJS is doing and how it is helping me build these static sites.
------------

### Day 27: October 8th, 2017, Sunday

- CSS styles in React
- Searchbar in IversonTube

**Thoughts**
- I learned how to add some styles to React. I've seen this done before but this is the first time I've seen them done in an actually css file instead of the directly in a component. I also made improvements to the IversonTube app to allow users to type in the searchbar and have the results of their request show up automatically.
------------

### Day 28: October 9th, 2017, Monday

- Throttling search term input for IversonTube

**Thoughts**
- I learned how to throttle user input in React to help make IversonTube search more user friendly. I completed IversonTube which is just a basic Youtube clone app. 
------------

### Day 29: October 10th, 2017, Tuesday

- First 5 days of 30 Days of React
- Started on Catch of the Day app by Wes Bos

**Thoughts**
- It was super super super helpful reading 30 Days of React book and taking notes. Learned alot more about React which makes it easier now to watch the video tutorials. I definitely came off with a better understanding of React and I will continue to read the book in the morning and practice the tutorial at night. 
------------

### Day 30: October 11th, 2017, Wednesday

- Created a couple of components for Catch of the Day app
- Learned about React props
  - React allows us to send data to a component in the same syntax as HTML
  - Access props by passing this.props inside a component
- Learned about state in React
  - State in a component is completely internal to that component
  - Can be accessed by this.state
  - Can be set by this.setState()

**Thoughts**
- Made a couple of simple components for Wes Bos course. The challenge for the day was getting emmett to work with VS Code and unforuntately I was unsuccessful. Continued reading 30 Days of React book and learned about props and state. I can fully understand props now but I still need some more practical examples of state and when/how to use it. 
------------

------------

### Day 33: October 14th, 2017, Saturday

- Stateless functional components on Catch of the Day app

**Thoughts**
- Learned that if I'm creating a component that is only going to render something, I can make it a stateless functional component. Helps you reduce and write more clean code for your projects. No classes needed or this codeword. 
------------

### Day 34: October 15th, 2017, Sunday

------------

### Day 51: November 8th, 2017 Wednesday

- Displaying the State in JSX on Catch-of-the-Day app

**Thoughts**
- Started working on Wes Bos React course again. Was able to render a new function within a componenet in order to show the order status and toal for the Catch-of-the-Day app. This was done through passing down state to the render function. It was a little in depth but I'm slowing beginning to understand it more. I will continue working with React until I perfect it. I also need to get back to coding more consistently. 
------------

### Day 52: November 10th, 2017 Friday

- Catch of the Day
  - Persisting our State with Firebase 
  - Persisting Order State with localStorage 
  
**Thoughts**
- Working on my Catch of the day React app. Learned how to get persisting state 2 different ways in our app. Firebase app by google is pretty cool, lets you update the data on the app in real time. Looking forward to using this in future projects. 
------------

### Day 53: November 12th, 2017 Sunday

- Catch of the Day App
  - Bi-directional Data Flow and Live State Editing
  - Removing Items from State

------------

### Day 55: November 14th, 2017 Tuesday

- Catch of the Day 
  - Authentication
  
**Thoughts**
- Today was an interesting day. Went to React DC meetup and learned about managing state in React with Redux. I haven't used Redux yet but I am excited to learn. With this Catch of the Day app, I already written alot of state components and it seems like a lot to manage. Today I also added some authentication to the Catch of the Day app. I am able to login with twitter, fb, and github. I used firebase to plugin these tools into the app. Firebase seems like an awesome tool and something I will be implementing alot in future apps. Depending on how I feel tomorrow, I should be able to finish this app.
------------

### Day 56: November 15th, 2017 Wednesday

- Catch of the Day App

**Thoughts**
- Today was definitely a learning day. I tried to import my Catch of the Day App into a subdomain hosted by my Blue Host account but unfortantly I wasn't able to get it work. I need to dedicate more time and research to see how to get my React app to upload to Blue Host. 
------------

### Day 57: November 16th, 2017 Thursday

- CSS Animations
  - Pseudo-classes
    - :hover
    - :focus
    - :active
  - Transforms
  
**Thoughts**
- Started a new course today, The Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp. I took the previous course offered by Colt Steele and this one has a lot more depth about becoming a proficient web developer. I plan to take my time throught this course because it covers so many different topics. Today I started on CSS Animations. I learned 3 pseudo-classes, hover, focus, and active. Hover is when you "hover" your mouse over the elment. Focus is when you click or tap on an element which causes it to be selected or "receive focus". Active is when you press down on an elment with your mouse and it ends once you release.
------------

### Day 58: November 18th, 2017 Saturday

- Code & Coffee Merrfield

**Thoughts**
- I went to a meet up today. Was interesting seeing so many people there. I need to start building an actual project in order to get insight from all these different developers. 
------------

### Day 59: November 20th, 2017 Monday

- Dang Thats Delicious

**Thoughts**
- Started a new project to learn MongoDB, Node, Javascript, and Express. Had some trouble getting Node to update but I finally got it to work. I need a new harddrive for my MacBook because I'm running out of space. I really want a new MacBook Pro but I can't afford one right now. If I get any money back from my taxes, I may possibly put that towards a new Pro purchase.
------------

### Day 60: November 21st, 2017 Tuesday

- React Native Nova Meetup

**Thoughts**
- Went to my first React Native meetup and it was pretty interesting. I can't wait to start learning more but I want to hold off until I get a good handle on regular React. The meetup did show a great site called snack.expo that lets you test code online and have it render directly on your phone with hot reloading. Once React is down, I will focus my attention on React/iOS apps.

Alot of the Node stuff went over my head and I will have to do some research to get a better understanding on what these things are and how to use for them. Focus over Laziness is my main goal now. Hopefully I can continue this streak.
------------

### Day 63: December 4th, 2017 Monday

- Wes Bos Learn Node
  - Geolocation
    - Saving Lat and Lng for each store
    - Geocoding Data with Google Maps
    
**Thoughts**
- Was able to add the address, lat, and lng fields to each store in order to store location information. I started doing the geocoding data with Google Maps but I was unable to get it to autocomplete the location address. Having some problems with the google api and their website doesn't make it as easy as possible. I think I was able to get the api to work but the autocomplete is still not working. I will search online and ask for help on web forms tomorrrow. 
------------

### Day 64: December 5th, 2017 Tuesday

- Wes Bos Learn Node

**Thoughts**
- Spent today trying to get the autocomplete to work to no avail. I want to get this feature working before I move on to the rest of the course. Going to spend some time on it tomorrow and if I don't get any progress, I will move on to his ES6 course.

Picked up a JS book by Jon Duckett and began reading that again. No actual computer coding, just going to read the whole back and then go back and do the lessons. Hopefully this method makes it easier for me to understand and grasp the concepts. 
------------
