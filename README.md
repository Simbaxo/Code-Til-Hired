- Complete Developer Podcast explained skill every web dev needs
  - API's, AJAX, and Callbacks
  - SQL databases
  - OWASP Development Guide
  - Data Structures
  - Modelling
  - SEO

**Thoughts:**
- Today was a great day. The simple blog app helped me gained a better understanding of RESTful routes. There were a lot of steps but it wasn't too bad. I'm highly motiviated to compelete the Web Developer Bootcamp course this course. Complete Developer Podcast gave me a great outline on skill's to research more in the future.

### Day 1: September 12th, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Learned about authentication using PassportJS.

**Thoughts:**
- Wasn't able to get much done today. Will finish up the rest of the authentication for my YelpCamp Project tomorrow. 
------------

### Day 2: September 13th, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Learned more about authentication and how to implement it into projects. 

**Thoughts:**
- Again, I didn't do much today but I am closer to finishing the authentication section of my YelpCamp Project. Will hopefully finish today and start on the next section which is refactoring some of the code. 
------------

### Day 3: September 14th, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Finished adding authentication for YelpCamp.
- Started refactoring the routes for YelpCamp.

**Thoughts:**
- Didn't spend too much time today but I was able to compelete the final portion of the authentication section for YelpCamp Project. Also did some refactoring of the routes page for the same app. Learned the different techniques to connect routes on different file pages and cleaning up the app.js file. Tomorrow will finish some more cleaning up and ready YDKJS.  
------------

### Day 4: September 15th, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Completed Chapter 3: Function vs Block Scope on YDKJS: Scopes & Closures.
  - Scope From Functions
  - Hiding In Plain Scope
  - Collision Avoidance
  - Functions as Scopes
  - Blocks As Scopes
- Completed Chapter 4: Hoisting on YDKJS: Scopes & Closures. 
  - Functions First

**Thoughts:**
- Spent my coding time today reading more about JavaScript. Learned more about functions and their scopes. Functions are the most common unit of scope in JS. Variables and functions that are declared inside another function are essentially "hidden" fro any of the enclosing "scopes". Block-scope refers to the idea that variables and functions can belong to an arbitrary block of code, rather than only to the enclosing function.
- All declarations in a scope, regardless of where they appear, are processed first before the code itself is executed. You can visualize this as declarations (variables and functions) being "moved" to the top of their respective scopes, which we call "hoisting". Declarations themselves are hoisted, but assignments, even assignments of function expressions, are not hoisted.

### Day 5: September 16th, 2017, Saturday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Attended a React workshop and built a basic app.
  - [React Powerpoint Slideshow](https://kucharskimaciej.github.io/devmeetings-react-redux-workshop/#/)
  
**Thoughts:**
- The workshop was pretty cool but I knew most of the things which gave me confidence in my abilities. 
------------

### Day 6: September 17th, 2017, Sunday

**Today's Progress/What I learned**:


- Went over powerpoint from React workshop.

**Thoughts:**
- Today was a slow day as far as coding. Didn't accomplish much but I hope to step it up in the next coming days.
------------

### Day 7: September 18th, 2017, Monday


- Prevented an unauthenticated user from creating a campground in YelpCamp Project.
- Save username + id to newly created campground

**Thoughts:**
- Pretty simple process to prevent an unauthenticated user from creating a campground. However, I do need more practice on saving the username/id to the newly created campground. That process took a couple more steps and some which I didn't full grasp yet. 
------------

### Day 8: September 19th, 2017, Tuesday


- Learned how to add Edit Route
- Learned how to add Destroy Route
- Added Authorization to both Edit and Destroy buttons
  - Learned the difference betweent Authenitcation & Authorization

**Thoughts**
- Spent a good chunck of time creating the routes for edit and destroy. User now have the ability to do both. Authorization was added so only certain users will be able to edit and delete campgrounds. Both buttons are also hidden until the correct user is logged in. This is achieved through authorization. Tommorrow I add the same features to the comments section of the YelpCamp app.
